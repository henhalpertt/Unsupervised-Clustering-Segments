# Unsupervised-Clustering-Segments
Identifying customer segments hidden in the data using Unsupervised ML techniques. 

## Overview: 

Applying unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Germany to identify 
customer segments hidden in the data. I will first explore and pre-process the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing)
unwanted outliers. With the cleaned customer spending data, I will then apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment
the transformed customer data. Finally, I will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist
the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

Key steps:
• Data cleaning
• Dimensionality reduction with PCA
• Unsupervised clustering
